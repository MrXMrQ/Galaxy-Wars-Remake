# Galaxy Wars: Unity Remake
Welcome to Galaxy Wars: Unity Remake, a revitalized version of my first-ever game project! Originally developed using Java and a basic Swing GUI, this game has now been reimagined with Unity to provide an enhanced gaming experience with new features, improved graphics, and more dynamic gameplay.

### Overview
Galaxy Wars is a space-themed arcade game where players must navigate through treacherous asteroid fields, collect coins, upgrade their ship, and survive for as long as possible. This project is a work in progress, with many exciting features still under development.

### Features
**Current Features**
- Asteroid Dodging Gameplay: Navigate through waves of asteroids, avoiding collisions to survive.
- Item Collection: Collect items that give you various advantages, such as power-ups and temporary shields.
- Coin System: Earn coins by surviving longer, which can be used to purchase upgrades and items.
- Upgrades: Enhance your ship’s abilities, including health, maneuverability, and speed.
- Boss Fights: Face off against massive asteroid clusters that require quick thinking and precise movement.

**Planned Features**
- New Levels and Environments: Explore new galaxies with unique challenges and increasingly difficult asteroid fields.
- Boss items: You can collect permanent upgrades
- Different weapon types: Sniper, Bomb, Triple, and more.
- Enhanced Visuals and Effects: Improved graphics, particle effects, and animations.
- Soundtrack and Sound Effects: Immersive audio to accompany your journey through space.
